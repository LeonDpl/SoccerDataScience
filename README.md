## Formalisation

- Key Performance Metrics
  - **xG** : Expected Goals, the probability of a shot resulting in a goal (0 to 1)
  - **PPDA** : Passes Per Defensive Actions, indication of the pressing intensity, number of passes opposing team makes before a defensive action
  - **Packing** : Measure of the passing/dribbling effectiveness, the number of defenders bypassed by a pass or a dribble.
  - **EPV** : Expected Possession Value, Pass probability * Pass Value
   
 - Concepts:
   - Line breaking
   - Backward passing
   - **PI** : Pass Value
   - **PC** : Pitch control
   - **PP** : Pass probability
