# SoccerDataScience

## Work

- 2025-06-30
  - Start a streamlit App

- 2025-06-25
  - Manipulate statsbombpy to prototype a function to get player data per game on a season

- 2025-06-21
  - Init a github repo
  - Do some research on soccer analytics, performance and domain specific knowledge
  - Init a notebook to explore Statsbomb data
  - TODO : 
    - Continue domain kowledge formalisation
      - List datasources and content and dataset samples
      - Organize state of the art related to soccer performance
    - Small app specification 
      - Expected functions:
        - Plot player / team metric over time during a game
        - ~~Plot player / team metric aggregated per game over time~~
      - Stack : which db?, flask, streamlit?

## Formalisation and Glossary

- Key Performance Metrics

| Acronym | Definition | Link |
| -- | -- | -- |
| xG |  Expected Goals, the probability of a shot resulting in a goal (0 to 1) | |
| xT |  Expected Threat, for attacking actions: passes, dribbles, carries etc. | [Soccermatics](https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lesson4/EvaluatingActions.html) |
| xD |  Expected Defense, for defending actions: interceptions, blocks | [Soccermatics](https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lesson4/EvaluatingActions.html) |
| PPDA | Passes Per Defensive Actions, indication of the pressing intensity, number of passes opposing team makes before a defensive action | |
| Packing | Measure of the passing/dribbling effectiveness, the number of defenders bypassed by a pass or a dribble | |
| EPV | Expected Possession Value, Pass probability * Pass Value | |
| Centralisation Index | Sum the difference between maximal number of successful passes by 1 player and number of successful passes by each player divided by the sum of all passes multiplied by (number of players - 1) 
   
 - Concepts:
   - Line breaking
   - Backward passing
   - **PI** : Pass Value
   - **PC** : Pitch control
   - **PP** : Pass probability
